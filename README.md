## Notes

1.  A `README.md` file - This file gives a short description of the
    paper and an overview of how to carry out the analyses presented in their manuscript.
2.  A `manuscript` directory - This directory will generally hold the source files
    (often LaTeX or Rmd) for the manuscript and any files directly related to the
    generation of the manuscript, including figure files.
3.  A `data` directory - This directory will generally hold the real data files 
    (or facsimile versions of them in place of confidential data) and simulated data files.
    See `data/README.md` for more details. 
4.  A `code` directory - This directory will generally hold 
    source code files that contain the core code to implement the method and various utility/auxiliary functions.
5.  An `output` directory - This directory will generally hold objects derived
    from computations, including results of simulations or real data analyses. See `output/README.md` for more details.
