## Data

Real data files (for the case study):

* raw_data_import_and_preprocessing.R is an R script containing the code for importing, preprocessing and merging the raw data input (downloadable from https://webfs.oecd.org/pisa2018/SPSS_STU_QQQ.zip and https://webfs.oecd.org/pisa2018/SPSS_SCH_QQQ.zip);

* df_level2.csv is the cleaned dataset produced by processing the raw input data mentioned above;


Simulated data files (for the simulation study):

### Abstract

### Availability

### Simulated data

### Description


## Code

### Optional Information

## Instructions for use

### Reproducibility

## Notes

1.  A `README.md` file - This file gives a short description of the
    paper and an overview of how to carry out the analyses presented in their manuscript.
2.  A `manuscript` directory - This directory will generally hold the source files
    (often LaTeX or Rmd) for the manuscript and any files directly related to the
    generation of the manuscript, including figure files.
3.  A `data` directory - This directory will generally hold the real data files 
    (or facsimile versions of them in place of confidential data) and simulated data files.
    See `data/README.md` for more details. 
4.  A `code` directory - This directory will generally hold 
    source code files that contain the core code to implement the method and various utility/auxiliary functions.
5.  An `output` directory - This directory will generally hold objects derived
    from computations, including results of simulations or real data analyses. See `output/README.md` for more details.





## MY THINGS:

* GLMM_case_study.R uses code/df_level2.csv in input and produces output/df_level2_pred.csv in output
