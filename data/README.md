This directory would generally contain the real data files (or facsimile versions of them in place of confidential data) and simulated data files.

Cleaned data that are produced by processing raw input data might also be placed here.

Code to generate the simulated data and (if relevant) and facsimile data provided in place of confidential real data might also be placed here. 

Code for data cleaning could potentially also be placed here rather than in `code`.


Real data files (for the case study):

* raw_data_import_and_preprocessing.R is an R script containing the code for importing, preprocessing and merging the raw data input (downloadable from https://webfs.oecd.org/pisa2018/SPSS_STU_QQQ.zip and https://webfs.oecd.org/pisa2018/SPSS_SCH_QQQ.zip);

* df_level2.csv is the cleaned dataset produced by processing raw input data;


Simulated data files (for the simulation study):
